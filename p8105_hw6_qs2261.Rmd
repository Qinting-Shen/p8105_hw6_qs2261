## Problem 3
Import data
```{r}
birthweight_raw = 
  read_csv(file = 'birthweight.csv')
```

Check for missing value
```{r}
birthweight_missing = 
  birthweight_raw |> 
  summarise_all(~sum(is.na(.)))
```

Clean data
```{r}
birthweight_df = 
  birthweight_raw|> 
  mutate(
    babysex = as.factor(babysex),
    frace = as.factor(frace),
    malform = as.factor(malform),
    mrace = as.factor(mrace)
    )
```
